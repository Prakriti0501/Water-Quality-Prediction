# Water-Quality-Prediction
I primarily focused on the backend development of the water quality prediction project. My role involved managing and processing the data obtained from Kaggle. I didn't directly handle the hardware part for data collection; instead My focus was on creating a strong backend for the prediction models by effectively utilizing the datasets that already existed.
